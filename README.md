Generate fonts and use them in Minecraft! This tool allows you to quickly create custom font resource packs for your Minecraft game, supporting a wide range of font types and game versions.

## Features
- **Fast Generation**: Generate font resource packs in just 1ms.
- **Font Type Support**: Supports True Type Font (TTF) and Open Type Font (OTF).
- **Version Compatibility**: Can generate resource packs for all supported Minecraft versions from 1.13 to 1.21.

## Supported Versions

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system. If Python is not installed, the `main.bat` script will automatically download and install Python 3.9.13 for you.

### Steps
1. **Run the Batch Script**:
    - Navigate to the project directory in the command prompt.
    - Run the {insert\_element\_1\_YG1haW4uYmF0YA==} script. This script will check if Python is installed. If not, it will download and install Python 3.9.13 silently and then execute the Python script.
2. **Open the Font Generator**:
    - After the Python script starts, an interface will appear (assuming it has a GUI).
3. **Configure the Font Resource Pack**:
    - **Open Font File**: Click the "Open" button and select your True Type Font (TTF) or Open Type Font (OTF) file.
    - **Set Icon**: You can choose an icon for your resource pack. This step may vary depending on the implementation.
    - **Set Name**: Enter a name for your font resource pack.
    - **Select Version**: Make sure to select the appropriate Minecraft version for which you want to generate the resource pack.
4. **Generate the Resource Pack**:
    - Click the "Generate" button. The tool will generate the font resource pack in a matter of milliseconds.
5. **Use the Resource Pack in Minecraft**:
    - Locate the generated resource pack file.
    - Open Minecraft and go to the "Options" menu, then select "Resource Packs".
    - Click "Open Pack Folder" and copy the generated resource pack file into this folder.
    - Back in the "Resource Packs" menu, move the newly added resource pack to the "Selected Packs" section.

## Installation
If you have cloned the repository, you can simply run the {insert\_element\_2\_YG1haW4uYmF0YA==} script. This script will handle the Python installation if necessary and execute the Python script to start the font generation process.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9.13 (will be installed automatically by {insert\_element\_3\_YG1haW4uYmF0YA==} if not present)
